service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read any user profile but only update their own
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Friendships require authentication
    match /friendships/{friendshipId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // User songs require authentication
    match /user_songs/{userSongId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Song shares require authentication
    match /song_shares/{shareId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Protection

- Activity feeds refresh automatically
